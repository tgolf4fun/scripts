#Simple Math
print "I will now count my chickens:"

#This should evaluate to 30 (30/6 + 25)
print "Hens", 25+30/6

#25*3 divided by 4 then subtract 100
print "Roosters", 100-25*3%4

print "Now I will count the eggs:"

print 3.0+2.0+1.0-5.0+4%2-1/4+6.0

print "Is it true that 3+2 < 5 -7?"

print "What is 3+2?", 3+2
print "What is 5-7?", 5-7

print "Oh, that's why it's False."

print "How about some more."

print "Is it greater?", 5>-2
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5>= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
